INSIGHTS

FOR 2020 YEAR,

- Bhubaneshwar has the highest profit margin % of all markets.

- Delhi NCR is the highest revenue generating market with contribution share of 54.7%, but is Delhi generating 54.7% profit? no.

- Even though Bhub has highest pm%, but most profit comes from Mumbai 

- Excel Store was the shop giving the highest profit - 12.5% of all other shops

- For Electricalsara Store, even though they have a very low profit margin (%) in their products, but still they are second - 11.9% when it comes to profit margin % contribution of all shops.It means they have taken many many orders.

-Lucknow has lowest profit margin % and in fact, in 2.5% loss, which is coming from only 1 store "Insight", so we might as well close that store or stop expansion in Lucknow.
